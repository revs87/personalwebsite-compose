We consider two splitting models, vertical splitting and half splitting, and have adapted data structures, scheduling and incremental copy procedures in YapOr to cope with the new models.

Our implementation shares the underlying execution environment and most of the data structures used to implement or-parallelism in YapOr.

The Muse and YapOr systems are arguably two of the most efficient systems for shared memory architectures, both based on the environment copying model. Stack splitting emerged as an alternative model specially geared to distributed shared memory architectures as it basically splits the computation in such a way that no further, or just minimal, synchronization is required."),

Our aim is to take advantage of its robustness to efficiently implement stack splitting support using shared memory, and then be able to directly compare the YapOr based on environment copying with the YapOr based on stack splitting. We devised two splitting schemes, the vertical splitting and the half splitting, and have adapted data structures, scheduling and incremental copying procedures in YapOr to cope with the new schemes. Finally, we evaluate their performance on a set of known benchmarks on a multicore machine with up to 24 cores. Our initial results confirm that YapOr with the stack splitting schemes is, in general, comparable to YapOr with environment copying, obtaining in some cases better performance than with environment copying."),
